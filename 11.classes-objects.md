# Understanding Classes and Objects 

## What is a Class?
A **class** in Java is like a blueprint or template that defines how an object should be created. It specifies the attributes (characteristics) and behaviors (actions) of an object.

### Syntax of a Class
```java
class ClassName {
    // Attributes (Properties)
    dataType attribute1;
    dataType attribute2;

    // Constructor
    public ClassName(parameter1, parameter2) {
        this.attribute1 = parameter1;
        this.attribute2 = parameter2;
    }

    // Methods (Behaviors)
    public void methodName() {
        // Method body
    }
}
```

### Real-Life Analogy: House Blueprint
Think of a house blueprint:
- It defines:
  - Number of rooms
  - Room dimensions
  - Layout
  - Basic structure
- However, it is just a **plan**, not an actual house.

Similarly, a **class** is just a template that defines how objects should be structured, but it is not an actual object itself.


### Java Example: House Blueprint
```java
public class House {
    // Attributes (Properties)
    String color;
    int numberOfRooms;
    double area;

    // Constructor (How to create a house)
    public House(String color, int rooms, double area) {
        this.color = color;
        this.numberOfRooms = rooms;
        this.area = area;
    }

    // Behavior (Methods)
    public void openDoor() {
        System.out.println("Door opened!");
    }
}
```

## What is an Object?
An **object** is a specific instance of a class. If a class is a blueprint, an object is the actual house built from that blueprint.

### Syntax of Creating an Object
```java
ClassName objectName = new ClassName(arguments);
```


### Creating Objects from a Class
```java
public class HouseBuilder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating house objects
        House blueHouse = new House("Blue", 3, 150.5);
        House redHouse = new House("Red", 4, 200.0);

        // Using object methods
        blueHouse.openDoor(); // Output: Door opened!
        redHouse.openDoor();  // Output: Door opened!
    }
}
```

Each object represents a real entity with actual values. The **blueHouse** and **redHouse** objects have different colors, room counts, and areas, but they are both created from the same class.

## Another Analogy: Car Manufacturing
A class can also be compared to a **car design**, and objects are actual cars built from that design.

### Class as Car Design
```java
public class Car {
    // Attributes
    String model;
    String color;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String model, String color, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method
    public void start() {
        System.out.println(model + " is starting!");
    }
}
```

### Objects as Actual Cars
```java
public class CarShowroom {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating car objects
        Car toyotaCamry = new Car("Toyota Camry", "Silver", 2023);
        Car hondaCivic = new Car("Honda Civic", "Blue", 2022);

        // Using object methods
        toyotaCamry.start();  // Output: Toyota Camry is starting!
        hondaCivic.start();   // Output: Honda Civic is starting!
    }
}
```

Here, the **Car** class defines what a car should be like, and actual cars (Toyota Camry and Honda Civic) are **objects** created from that class.

## Key Differences Between a Class and an Object

| Feature        | Class (Blueprint) | Object (Instance) |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | A template that defines properties and behavior | A specific example of the class |
| **Exists as**  | Code in a program | A real entity in memory |
| **Example**   | Car design | Actual car |
| **Multiplicity** | One class can create multiple objects | Many objects can be created from a class |
| **Usage** | Defines attributes and methods | Stores actual data and performs actions |

## Simple Metaphor: Cookie Cutter vs. Cookies
- **Class = Cookie Cutter** → Defines the shape of cookies but is not a cookie itself.
- **Objects = Cookies** → Different cookies made using the same cutter but with different decorations and flavors.

---

## Common Terminologies
- **Instantiation**: The process of creating an object from a class.
- **Instance**: Another word for an object.
- **new Keyword**: Used to create a new object in Java.
  ```java
  House myHouse = new House("Green", 5, 250.0); // Instantiating an object
  ```

## Real-World Thinking
Imagine your **smartphone**:
- **Class**: The phone model design (e.g., iPhone 14, Samsung Galaxy S23)
- **Object**: The actual phone in your hand
- Each phone follows the same blueprint but has different characteristics like owner, wallpaper, and installed apps.
