### What is a Virtual Machine?
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer system. It allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine by abstracting the hardware resources and providing a virtual environment for each operating system. VMs are widely used for various purposes, including running multiple operating systems simultaneously, isolating applications, and enabling cloud computing services.

### What is JVM?
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is an integral part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and is responsible for executing Java bytecode. It provides a platform-independent environment, allowing Java programs to run on any device that has a JVM installed.

### Class Loader Subsystem with JVM Architecture

The Java ClassLoader is an integral part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that dynamically loads Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java run time system does not need to know about files and file systems because of classloaders. Java classes aren’t loaded into memory all at once, but when required by an application. At this point, the Java ClassLoader is called by the JRE, and these ClassLoaders load classes into memory dynamically.

ClassLoaders play a crucial role in Java’s ability to dynamically load classes into memory as needed, enabling flexibility and efficiency in Java applications.

#### Class Loader Subsystem Internally Performs 3 Tasks
a) Loading  
b) Linking  
c) Initialization  

#### Loading
In order to load the required `.class` file, JVM makes a request to the class loader subsystem. The class loader subsystem follows the delegation hierarchy algorithm to load the required `.class` files from different areas.

To load the required `.class` file, we have 3 different kinds of class loaders:

![Classloader](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Pxby4WoDlb6mqFcq0LEMkg.png "Classloader")

1. **Bootstrap/Primordial Class Loader**  
   - It is responsible for loading the required `.class` files from the Java API, meaning all the predefined classes (provided by the Java software) will be loaded by the Bootstrap class loader.
   - It is the superclass of the Extension class loader and has the highest priority among all class loaders.

2. **Extension/Platform Class Loader**  
   - It is responsible for loading the required `.class` files from the `ext` (extension) folder. Inside the extension folder, we have JAR files (Java-level zip files) given by third parties or user-defined JAR files.
   - It is the superclass of the Application class loader and has higher priority than the Application class loader.

3. **Application/System Class Loader**  
   - It is responsible for loading the required `.class` file from the classpath level, i.e., the environment variable.
   - It has the lowest priority and is a subclass of the Extension/Platform class loader.

**Note:**  
If all the class loaders fail to load the `.class` file into JVM memory, a runtime exception occurs: `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException`.

**Note:**  
Command to create a JAR file:
```
jar cf Test.jar FileName.class
```
Here, `FileName.class` will be placed inside the JAR file.

#### Example Program: Any `.class` File Return Type is `java.lang.Class`
```java
package com.test;

class Employee {}

class Student {}

class Customer {}

public class DotClassReturnType {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.lang.Class cls = Employee.class;
        System.out.println(cls.getName());

        cls = Student.class;
        System.out.println(cls.getName());

        cls = Customer.class;
        System.out.println(cls.getName());
    }
}
```

#### `getClassLoader()` Method
`getClassLoader()` is a predefined method of the `Class` class available in the `java.lang` package, and its return type is `ClassLoader`.

**Example Program: Application Class Loader**
```java
package com.test;

class Test {}

public class ClassLoaderInformation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Test.class file will be loaded by : " + Test.class.getClassLoader());
    }
}
```

#### `getParent()` Method
`getParent()` is a predefined method of the `ClassLoader` class in Java, available in the `java.lang` package. It is an abstract class.

**Example:**
```java
package com.test;

class Player {}

public class ParentClassLoader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Parent of Application class Loader is : " + Player.class.getClassLoader().getParent());
        System.out.println("Parent of Platform class Loader is : " + Player.class.getClassLoader().getParent().getParent());
    }
}
```

**Note:**  
Bootstrap class loader implementation is not provided because it is used to load predefined `.class` files.

#### Linking
- **Verify:**  
  It ensures the correctness of the `.class` files. If any suspicious activity is detected in the `.class` file, it will stop execution immediately by throwing an exception: `java.lang.VerifyError`.

  **ByteCodeVerifier:**  
  A component of the JVM responsible for verifying the loaded `.class` file (bytecode). Due to this verification module, Java is a highly secure language.

  `java.lang.VerifyError` is a subclass of `java.lang.LinkageError`.

- **Prepare:**  
  It allocates memory for all static data members. Here, all static data members will get default values. For example, if we have:
  ```java
  static int x = 100;
  ```
  then for variable `x`, memory will be allocated and initialized with the default value `0`.

- **Resolve:**  
  All symbolic references will be converted to direct references or actual references.

  **Command to read internal details of `.class` file:**
  ```
  javap -verbose FileName.class
  ```

#### Initialization
In Initialization, all static data members will get their actual (original) values, and if any static block is present in the class, the static block will start executing from here.

#### Static Block
- It is a special block that is automatically executed when the `.class` file is loaded into JVM memory.
- Static blocks are executed only once because class loading is possible only once.
- The main purpose of the static block is to initialize the static data members of the class, so it is also known as a static initializer.
- A blank static final variable can also be initialized through a static block only.
- If a class contains multiple static blocks, they will be executed in order.
- Static blocks are executed before the `main` method or any static method.
- The compiler will generate an illegal forward reference if a user tries to access the static variable value from a static block without declaration.

**Example:**
```java
class Foo {
    Foo() {
        System.out.println("No Argument constructor..");
    }

    {
        System.out.println("Instance block..");
    }

    static {
        System.out.println("Static block...");
    }
}

public class StaticBlockDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main Method Executed ");
    }
}
```

**Note:**  
The static block will not be executed because the `Foo.class` file is not loaded into JVM memory.

#### Static Blocks Executed in Order
```java
class Test {
    static int x;

    static {
        x = 100;
        System.out.println("x value is :" + x);
    }

    static {
        x = 200;
        System.out.println("x value is :" + x);
    }

    static {
        x = 300;
        System.out.println("x value is :" + x);
    }

    static {
        x = 400;
        System.out.println("x value is :" + x);
    }
}

public class StaticBlockDemo1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Test.x);
    }
}
```

#### Static Variables Initialized with Default Values
```java
class Foo {
    static int x;

    static {
        System.out.println("x value is :" + x);
    }
}

public class StaticBlockDemo2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Foo();
    }
}
```

#### Static Blank Final Variable Initialization
```java
class Demo {
    final static int a; // blank final static variable

    static {
        a = 100; // Initialization is compulsory
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}

public class StaticBlockDemo3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("a value is :" + Demo.a);
    }
}
```

#### Output
```java
class A {
    static {
        System.out.println("A");
    }

    {
        System.out.println("B");
    }

    A() {
        System.out.println("C");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    static {
        System.out.println("D");
    }

    {
        System.out.println("E");
    }

    B() {
        System.out.println("F");
    }
}

public class StaticBlockDemo4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new B();
    }
}
```

#### Illegal Forward Reference
```java
class Demo {
    static {
        i = 100; // Initialization is possible
        // System.out.println(i); // Invalid, accessing is not possible
    }

    static int i;
}

public class StaticBlockDemo5 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Demo.i);
    }
}
```

#### Static Block Execution
```java
class StaticBlockDemo7 {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static Block");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main Method");
    }
}
```

#### Can We Execute a Java Program Without `main` Method?
We cannot execute a Java program without a `main` method. Up to JDK 1.6, it was possible to execute a Java program without a `main` method by writing a static block.

From JDK 1.7 onwards, it is not possible to execute a Java program without a `main` method because the JVM verifies the presence of the `main` method before initializing the class.

**Example:**
```java
class WithoutMain {
    static {
        System.out.println("Hello world");
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

The above program was possible to execute up to JDK 1.6.

#### Ways to Load `.class` File into JVM Memory
There are multiple ways to load the `.class` file into JVM memory. The following are common examples:

1. **By using Java tools (`java` command)**  
   ```
   javac Test.java
   java Test [Load the Test.class file into JVM memory]
   ```

2. **By using Constructor (Object creation)**

3. **By accessing the static member of the class**  
   ```java
   System.out.println(Demo.x);
   ```

4. **By using Inheritance**  
   When we create an object for the subclass, the superclass `.class` file will be loaded first, followed by the subclass `.class` file.

5. **By using Reflection API**  
   Java provides a predefined class called `Class` in the `java.lang` package. This class contains a predefined static method `forName(String className)`, through which we can load the required `.class` file into JVM memory dynamically. It throws a checked exception: `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException`.

**Example Program:**
```java
class Demo {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static Block of Demo class");
    }
}

public class DynamicLoading {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Class.forName("Demo");
    }
}
```

#### Limitation of the `new` Keyword
The limitation of the `new` keyword is that it demands the class name at the beginning or at the time of compilation. Therefore, the `new` keyword is not suitable for creating objects for classes that are dynamically loaded from a database or files at runtime.

To create objects for classes that are dynamically loaded at runtime, we should use the `newInstance()` method available in the `java.lang.Class` class.

**Example Program:**
```java
public class CreateObjectDynamically {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Object obj = Class.forName(args[0]).newInstance();
        System.out.println("Object created for :" + obj.getClass().getName() + " class");
    }
}

class Employee {}
class Player {}
class Customer {}
```

**Command to create an object for the `Employee` class:**
```
javac CreateObjectDynamically.java (Compilation)
java CreateObjectDynamically Employee
```

#### Difference Between `new` Keyword and `newInstance()` Method
The `new` keyword requires the class name at compile-time, making it unsuitable for dynamically loaded classes. The `newInstance()` method allows creating objects for classes loaded at runtime.

**Example Program:**
```java
class Manager {
    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello Manager, Good Evening");
    }
}

public class CreateObjectDynamically {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Object obj = Class.forName(args[0]).newInstance();
        Manager m = (Manager) obj; // Down Casting
        m.greet();
    }
}
```

#### Difference Between `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException` and `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError`

**`java.lang.ClassNotFoundException`:**  
It occurs when we try to load the required `.class` file at runtime using `Class.forName()` or `loadClass()` method of the `ClassLoader` class, and the required `.class` file is not available at runtime.

**Example Program:**
```java
class Foo {
    static {
        System.out.println("static block gets executed...");
    }
}

public class ClassNotFoundExceptionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ClassNotFoundException {
        Class.forName("Player");
    }
}
```

If the `Player.class` file is not available at runtime, a `ClassNotFoundException` will be thrown.

**`java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError`:**  
It occurs when the class was present at the time of compilation but is not available at runtime (e.g., manually deleted by the user or not present in the current directory).

**Example Program:**
```java
class Test {
    public void getEnrollment() {
        System.out.println("Enrollment Done");
    }
}

public class NoClassDefFoundErrorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test n = new Test();
        n.getEnrollment();
    }
}
```

If the `Test.class` file is manually deleted, a `NoClassDefFoundError` will be thrown.

**Conclusion:**  
`java.lang.ClassNotFoundException` does not have any concern at compilation time, whereas `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError` checks the class name at compilation time.

### Runtime Data Areas

![Runtime Data Area](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:717/1*sG2wIZg7SqyhKMKD1jxM9A.png "Runtime Data Area")

#### a) Method Area
-------------------
The Method Area is a shared resource among all threads in the JVM. It stores the following class-level information:

- **Class Name:** The fully qualified name of the class.
- **Superclass Name:** The name of the immediate superclass.
- **Package Name:** The package to which the class belongs.
- **Fields:** All instance and static fields declared in the class.
- **Methods:** All methods (including constructors) declared in the class.
- **Constants:** Constants defined in the class.
- **Static Variables:** The values of static variables.
- **Runtime Constant Pool:** A table of constants used by the class, including literals and symbolic references.

When a `.class` file is loaded into the JVM, its contents are stored in the Method Area. This area is essential for the JVM to understand the structure and behavior of the class. The `java.lang.Class` object represents this class information and can be obtained using:
```java
Class c = AnyClass.class;
```

**Example Program: Getting Complete Information Regarding the Class**
2 files:
---------
**Student.java**
```java
package com.test.class_information;

public class Student {
    int roll = 101;
    String name = "Test";
    String address = "JNTUH";
    static String collegeName = "Test University";
    
    public Student() {}
    
    public void input() {}
    
    public void accept() {}
    
    public void display() {}
    
    public void show() {}
}
```

**ClassDescription.java**
```java
package com.test.class_information;

import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;
import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

public class ClassDescription {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Class cls = Class.forName(args[0]);
        
        System.out.println("Class Name is :" + cls.getName());
        System.out.println("Package Name is :" + cls.getPackageName());
        
        System.out.println("Methods available in the class :");
        Method[] methods = cls.getDeclaredMethods();
        int count = 0;
        for (Method method : methods) {
            System.out.println(method.getName());
            count++;
        }
        System.out.println("Total Methods are :" + count);
        
        System.out.println("Constructor Information");
        Constructor[] constructors = cls.getDeclaredConstructors();
        for (Constructor constructor : constructors) {
            System.out.println(constructor.getName());
        }
        
        System.out.println("Field Information :");
        Field[] fields = cls.getDeclaredFields();
        for (Field field : fields) {
            System.out.println(field.getName());
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:**  
- `getDeclaredMethods()` is a predefined method available in the `java.lang.Class` class. The return type of this method is a `Method` array, where `Method` is a predefined class available in the `java.lang.reflect` subpackage.
- `getDeclaredFields()` is a predefined method available in the `java.lang.Class` class. The return type of this method is a `Field` array, where `Field` is a predefined class available in the `java.lang.reflect` subpackage.
- `getDeclaredConstructors()` is a predefined method available in the `java.lang.Class` class. The return type of this method is a `Constructor` array, where `Constructor` is a predefined class available in the `java.lang.reflect` subpackage.

#### b) HEAP Memory
--------------------
The HEAP Memory is used to store objects and their instance variables. It is a shared resource among all threads in the JVM. When an object is created using the `new` keyword, it is allocated memory in the HEAP. The HEAP is managed by the Garbage Collector (GC), which automatically reclaims memory from objects that are no longer in use.

**Key Features of HEAP Memory:**
- **Dynamic Allocation:** Objects are dynamically allocated memory in the HEAP during runtime.
- **Garbage Collection:** The JVM periodically runs the Garbage Collector to free up memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced.
- **Thread Safety:** The HEAP is shared among all threads, making it essential to manage concurrent access to objects stored in the HEAP.

**Example:**
```java
public class HeapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object in HEAP memory
        Student student = new Student();
        student.roll = 101;
        student.name = "Test";
        student.address = "JNTUH";
        
        // Accessing instance variables
        System.out.println("Student Roll: " + student.roll);
        System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.name);
        System.out.println("Student Address: " + student.address);
    }
}
```

#### c) Stack Area
--------------
The Stack Area is used for method execution. Each thread has its own Stack Area, which is divided into multiple Stack Frames. A Stack Frame is created whenever a method is called and is used to store:

- **Local Variables:** Variables declared within the method.
- **Frame Data:** Information about the method, such as the method's parameters and return type.
- **Operand Stack:** A temporary storage area used during method execution.

Once the method execution is complete, the corresponding Stack Frame is removed from the Stack.

**Key Features of Stack Area:**
- **Thread-Specific:** Each thread has its own Stack Area, ensuring that method execution is isolated to the thread.
- **LIFO Order:** Stack Frames are managed in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. The most recently created Stack Frame is the first to be removed when the method execution completes.
- **Efficient Method Execution:** The Stack Area provides a fast and efficient way to manage method calls and local variables.

**Example:**
```java
public class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Method call creates a new Stack Frame
        int result = add(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }

    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        // Local variables and method execution
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

#### d) PC Register
--------------
The Program Counter (PC) Register is used to track the current execution point in a thread. Each thread has its own PC Register, which points to the next instruction to be executed. The PC Register is essential for managing the execution flow of multiple threads in the JVM.

**Key Features of PC Register:**
- **Thread-Specific:** Each thread has its own PC Register, ensuring that the execution flow is isolated to the thread.
- **Instruction Pointer:** The PC Register points to the next instruction to be executed, allowing the JVM to manage the execution flow efficiently.
- **Support for Multithreading:** The PC Register enables the JVM to support multiple threads of execution by keeping track of the execution point for each thread.

#### e) Native Method Stack
--------------------------
The Native Method Stack is used to store information related to native methods. Native methods are methods written in languages other than Java, such as C or C++. When a Java method calls a native method, the JVM uses the Native Method Stack to manage the execution of the native code.

**Key Features of Native Method Stack:**
- **Native Code Execution:** The Native Method Stack is used to manage the execution of native code, ensuring that native methods can be called from Java.
- **Interoperability:** This stack allows Java programs to interact with native libraries, providing access to system-level resources and performance-critical operations.
- **Separate from Java Stack:** The Native Method Stack is separate from the Java Stack, ensuring that native method execution does not interfere with the execution of Java methods.




### Execution Engine
The Execution Engine is a crucial component of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) responsible for executing Java bytecode. It ensures that the bytecode is interpreted or compiled into native machine code, allowing the program to run efficiently on any platform that supports the JVM. The Execution Engine comprises several key components, including the Interpreter, the Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler, the Garbage Collector, the Java Native Interface (JNI), and the Java Native Method Library. Each of these components plays a vital role in the overall performance and functionality of the JVM.

![Execution Engine](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*drUa6ici-IseljLXd7OZDA.png "Execution Engine")

#### Interpreter
The Interpreter is a fundamental part of the Execution Engine that reads and executes Java bytecode line by line. This approach ensures platform independence, as the same bytecode can be executed on any platform with a compatible JVM.

**Key Features of Interpreter:**
- **Platform Independence:** The Interpreter ensures that Java bytecode can be executed on any platform that has a JVM, adhering to Java's "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) philosophy.
- **Bytecode Execution:** The Interpreter reads and executes bytecode instructions sequentially, providing a straightforward execution model. This allows for easy debugging and step-by-step execution.
- **Performance Overhead:** Interpreting each instruction can be slow, leading to performance overhead for Java programs. This is because each instruction must be decoded and executed individually, which can be time-consuming.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Execution Model:** The Interpreter executes bytecode instructions one by one. It fetches each instruction, decodes it, and then performs the corresponding action. This process is repeated for each instruction in the bytecode.
- **Debugging and Development:** The Interpreter's step-by-step execution model makes it easier to debug Java programs. Developers can step through the code line by line, inspecting the state of the program at each step.
- **Portability:** The Interpreter is a key component in making Java programs portable. Since the bytecode is interpreted at runtime, the same bytecode can be executed on any platform that has a compatible JVM.

#### JIT Compiler
The Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler is a component of the Execution Engine that compiles frequently executed bytecode into native machine code at runtime. This optimization significantly improves the execution speed of Java programs by reducing the overhead of interpretation.

**Key Features of JIT Compiler:**
- **Dynamic Compilation:** The JIT Compiler compiles bytecode into native machine code at runtime, optimizing frequently executed code. This allows the JVM to execute the optimized native code instead of interpreting the bytecode.
- **Performance Improvement:** By reducing the overhead of interpretation, the JIT Compiler significantly improves the execution speed of Java programs. This is particularly noticeable in long-running applications where certain code paths are executed frequently.
- **Hotspot Optimization:** The JIT Compiler identifies and optimizes hotspots in the code, focusing on the most frequently executed parts of the program. This selective optimization ensures that the most critical parts of the application are executed as efficiently as possible.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Dynamic Nature:** The JIT Compiler operates dynamically at runtime. It monitors the execution of the program and identifies code that is executed frequently. This "hot" code is then compiled into native machine code, which can be executed much faster than interpreted bytecode.
- **Selective Optimization:** The JIT Compiler does not compile the entire program into native code at once. Instead, it focuses on optimizing the most frequently executed parts of the program. This approach ensures that the compilation process does not introduce unnecessary overhead and that the most critical parts of the application are optimized for performance.
- **Integration with JVM:** The JIT Compiler works seamlessly with the JVM's Interpreter. When the Interpreter encounters a piece of code that is executed frequently, it hands off the compilation task to the JIT Compiler. Once the code is compiled into native machine code, the JVM can execute it directly, bypassing the Interpreter.
- **Adaptive Optimization:** Modern JIT Compilers use adaptive optimization techniques. They continuously monitor the performance of the application and make adjustments to the compiled code as needed. This allows the JIT Compiler to adapt to changing execution patterns and optimize the application dynamically.

**Example:**
```java
public class JITExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This loop will be optimized by the JIT Compiler
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the JIT Compiler will optimize the loop, making the execution faster by converting the frequently executed bytecode into native machine code. This optimization is done at runtime, and the resulting native code is cached for future use, further improving performance.

#### Garbage Collector
The Garbage Collector (GC) is another essential component of the Execution Engine. It is responsible for managing memory in the JVM by automatically reclaiming memory from objects that are no longer in use. This automatic memory management helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related issues.

**Key Features of Garbage Collector:**
- **Automatic Memory Management:** The Garbage Collector automatically reclaims memory from objects that are no longer referenced, preventing memory leaks.
- **Efficiency:** Modern Garbage Collectors use advanced algorithms to efficiently manage memory, ensuring that the JVM runs smoothly and efficiently.
- **Concurrent Execution:** Many Garbage Collectors operate concurrently with the application, minimizing pause times and improving overall performance.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Memory Management:** The Garbage Collector tracks all objects created in the JVM and identifies those that are no longer reachable. These objects are considered "garbage" and are eligible for collection.
- **Mark and Sweep Algorithm:** One of the most common algorithms used by Garbage Collectors is the Mark and Sweep algorithm. This algorithm marks all reachable objects and then sweeps through the memory to reclaim space from unmarked objects.
- **Generational Collection:** Modern JVMs often use a generational approach to garbage collection. Objects are divided into different generations based on their age. Younger objects are collected more frequently, while older objects are collected less often. This approach improves efficiency by focusing on the most likely candidates for garbage collection.
- **Concurrent Garbage Collection:** Many modern Garbage Collectors operate concurrently with the application, allowing the JVM to continue executing while memory is being reclaimed. This minimizes pause times and improves overall performance.

**Example:**
```java
public class GarbageCollectorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object that will be eligible for garbage collection
        Object obj = new Object();
        obj = null; // Object is no longer referenced and is eligible for garbage collection

        // Requesting the JVM to run the garbage collector (though it's not guaranteed to run immediately)
        System.gc();
    }
}
```

In this example, the object created is no longer referenced after setting `obj` to `null`. The Garbage Collector will eventually reclaim the memory used by this object, ensuring efficient memory management.

#### Java Native Interface (JNI)
The Java Native Interface (JNI) is a programming framework that allows Java code running in the JVM to call and be called by native applications (such as those written in C or C++) and libraries. JNI provides a bridge between Java and native code, enabling Java programs to interact with system-level resources and performance-critical operations.

**Key Features of JNI:**
- **Interoperability:** JNI allows Java programs to call native methods and access native data types, enabling seamless interaction between Java and native code.
- **Performance:** Native methods can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks or access system-level resources, providing performance benefits.
- **Platform-Specific Code:** JNI allows Java programs to include platform-specific code, enabling the use of system-level resources and hardware-specific features.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Native Methods:** JNI allows Java programs to declare and call native methods, which are implemented in languages such as C or C++. These native methods can perform tasks that are not possible or efficient in Java, such as direct memory access or system-level operations.
- **Data Access:** JNI provides mechanisms for accessing and manipulating native data types from Java. This includes passing primitive data types, objects, and arrays between Java and native code.
- **Loading Native Libraries:** JNI allows Java programs to load native libraries, which contain the implementation of native methods. These libraries can be loaded dynamically at runtime, enabling the use of native code without modifying the Java source code.
- **Error Handling:** JNI provides mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions that occur in native code. This ensures that errors in native code can be properly reported and handled in the Java program.

**Example:**
```java
public class JNIExample {
    static {
        // Load the native library
        System.loadLibrary("nativeLibrary");
    }

    // Declare a native method
    public native void nativeMethod();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JNIExample example = new JNIExample();
        example.nativeMethod();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `JNIExample` class declares a native method `nativeMethod()`, which is implemented in a native library. The native library is loaded using `System.loadLibrary()`, and the native method is called from the Java program.

#### Java Native Method Library
The Java Native Method Library is a collection of native libraries that provide the implementation for native methods declared in Java. These libraries are typically written in languages such as C or C++ and are compiled into shared libraries (such as DLLs on Windows or shared objects on Unix-based systems).

**Key Features of Java Native Method Library:**
- **Implementation of Native Methods:** The Java Native Method Library provides the implementation for native methods declared in Java. This allows Java programs to perform tasks that are not possible or efficient in Java.
- **System-Level Access:** Native libraries can access system-level resources and hardware-specific features, enabling Java programs to interact with the underlying operating system and hardware.
- **Performance Optimization:** Native libraries can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks, providing performance benefits for Java programs.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Native Method Implementation:** The Java Native Method Library contains the implementation for native methods declared in Java. These native methods are implemented in languages such as C or C++ and are compiled into shared libraries.
- **Loading Native Libraries:** Java programs can load native libraries using `System.loadLibrary()` or `System.load()`. These methods load the native libraries into the JVM, making the native methods available for use.
- **Interoperability:** The Java Native Method Library enables seamless interoperability between Java and native code. Java programs can call native methods and access native data types, while native code can call Java methods and access Java objects.
- **Error Handling:** The Java Native Method Library provides mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions that occur in native code. This ensures that errors in native code can be properly reported and handled in the Java program.

**Example:**
```c
#include <jni.h>
#include <stdio.h>

JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_JNIExample_nativeMethod(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj) {
    printf("Hello from native method!\n");
}
```

In this example, the `nativeMethod()` is implemented in a native library written in C. The `Java_JNIExample_nativeMethod` function is the native implementation of the `nativeMethod()` declared in the Java class `JNIExample`. The native library is compiled into a shared library, which is loaded by the Java program using `System.loadLibrary()`.
